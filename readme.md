#### documentation CI / CD
Please keep in mind that it's possible to 
1. provide a mermaid-to-excalidraw diagram input to excalidraw
2. simply save and open a file in excalidraw-collaboration or VSCode with .excalidraw.svg or .excalidraw.png extensions
3. moreover export stable versions of diagrams with exportToSvg or exportToBlob for more versatile image mime types such as image/jpg

##### version
This was done with excalidraw:v0.18.0-fork-b2
